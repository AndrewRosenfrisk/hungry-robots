# Hungry Robots

## About

You are trapped in a maze with hungry robots! You don’t know why robots need to eat, 
but you don’t want to find out. The robots are badly programmed and will move directly 
toward you, even if blocked by walls. You must trick the robots into crashing into each 
other (or dead robots) without being caught.

You have a personal teleporter device that can send you to a random new place, but it 
only has enough battery for two trips. Also, you and the robots can slip through corners!
